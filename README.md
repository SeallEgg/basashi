My personal NixOS configuration. Very much a WIP.

### hosts:
- enterprise: simple config for VMs. Not really in use at the moment.
- columbia: my desktop computer (7800X3D + 4070 Super), used for gaming and playing around with Linux. 
- challenger: my Thinkpad L13 Gen 3 AMD, used primarily for studying in university.
- ~~discovery~~: my homelab/NAS. Not yet built. 

Mostly based on the structure of [fazzi's NixOhEss configuration](https://gitlab.com/fazzi/nixohess). In fact, some files were (at least initially) stolen verbatim.
